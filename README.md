## Contents

The repository is organized into two main sections:
**Algorithm Analysis.**

This section delves into the essential principles and techniques integral to algorithm analysis. It encompasses a thorough exploration of asymptotic notations, such as Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega, for describing algorithmic growth rates. The analysis extends to both nonrecursive and recursive algorithms, involving mathematical approaches to count assignment and comparison operators in nonrecursive pseudocode, prove theorems related to algorithmic notations, and apply tools like the Master Theorem, Generating Functions, or alternative methods for analyzing recursive functions. Empirical analysis complements theoretical understanding, employing practical experiments to assess algorithm performance in real-world scenarios.

Algorithm Design Strategies
Dive into various algorithm design strategies, including Divide And Conquer, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy algorithms.
